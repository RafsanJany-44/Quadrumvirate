A library management system implemented in PHP, with attention to details like:
* Separate user roles for Librarian and Member
* Member registration and book issue must be confirmed by a Librarian
* Automatic email confirmation to members on successful registration and book issue
* Automatic email reminders to book issuers to return books
* Automatic penalty deduction on returning a book after the due date

**Note:** Please use the username *genesis* and password *librarian* for logging into the Librarian portal
